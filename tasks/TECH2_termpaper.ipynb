    "\n",
    "After analyzing electricity prices in NO2 and Germany, we observe overall increased price alignment following the opening of Nordlink, December 9, 2020, which is a result of improved cross-border balancing of energy. Electricity prices varied independently prior to Nordlink, however, these prices seem more synchronized after the opening, meaning that this cable has facilitated for more supply and demand adjustments. Despite all of this, as the subplots show, both countries are experiencing price spikes, which is highly likely due to the recent European energy crisis. The countries experienced most variation in the same timeframe, which also underscores the fact that prices became increasinly similar after Nordlink's deployment. \n",
    "The prices in NO2 have increased after the opening of Nordlink, and we can see a stable (or even slightly decrease) electricity price in Germany. This may be a result of greater exposure to European prices for Norway (E.G. fuel prices), while Germany has benefited from a stabilizing effect that has helped them contain their prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Negative electricity prices can occur when a country has an oversupply of electricity during periods with low demand. This situation is often made worse by subsidies or rules that encourage renewable energy producers to keep generating power even when demand is low, since stopping and restarting production can be costly and inefficient.

    "Conclusion: \n",
    "The correlation coefficient of 0.57 indicates a positive correlation between the weekly sum of net exports and the weekly average price difference. This suggests that as electricity prices in Germany rise, their imports from Norway also tend to increase. The scatter plot supports this relationship, showing that higher price differences generally align with increased imports from Norway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, there is very little activity when the price difference is high but net exports are negative (indicating Norway is importing more than exporting). Similarly, there is minimal activity when the price difference is negative (meaning prices are lower in Germany), yet Norway is exporting more than importing. This pattern supports the idea that price differences drive export flows, with higher exports typically occurring when prices are higher in Germany than in Norway."

ChatGPT helped us understand how to write different lines of code correctly and more efficiently. However, every time we used ChatGPT, we made sure to understand everything it said, and test it to consider whether it gave us the result we wanted. Overall making sure that we did not use ChatGPT in a way that we did not understand. ChatGPT helped us re-structure our code, for instance in how to calculate weekly sums and calculate correlation and refine the code to make it more readable \n",

By reading through previous notes, official documentation and Stack Overflow, we were able to understand how to code in the correct way. Our usage of AI has definitely helped us make our code more readable, efficient and helped us out with problems. Importantly, we thoroughly reviewed and tested all AI-generated suggetions we got, to ensure that we fully understood each solution (line of code) and that the final result from this line align with our expectations.
